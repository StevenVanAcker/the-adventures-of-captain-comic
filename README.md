# The Adventures of Captain Comic -- world map

This is a lazy dump, and I don't plan to update this repository further once
I've released it.

When she was young, my best friend played a shareware game from 1988 called
["The Adventures Of Captain Comic", created by Michael Denio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Captain_Comic). 
Despite many many hours spent trying to beat the game, she was stuck and never
managed to finish it.

For her birthday, I decided to partly reverse engineer the game in order to
figure out how the game could be beaten. The result of this effort is a
[map](map.pdf) of all levels in the game, showing where all items are placed
and how to navigate between the levels using the doors in the game.

In addition, I've created 2 special versions of the game (in tarballs), placed
on an installation of [recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/) on a raspberry pi
that I gave to her as part of her birthday present, to be played on her
birthday.

* a version where the first level shows some birthday wishes as part of the
  first level
* a "god mode" cheat version where the player can not die

### Disclaimer

I assume I am not breaking any copyright here.  This game is shareware and has
been abandoned for many years. I've tried to contact the author to give a
donation (and also record a message for my friend), but was unable to locate
him.  The game is up for download at
https://archive.org/details/TheAdventuresOfCaptainComic as well, so I assume it
is not a problem to place it on github.
